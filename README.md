# Numerical-Analysis-for-PDE
This repository contains some python scripts for solving numerically Partial Differential Equations 
(PDE).// 
These python scripts were developed during a course of Numerical analysis for partial differential Equations attended in TU Delft.
//
A small explanation of the mathematical problems solved in each script will be added soon.
