# Numerical-Analysis-for-PDE
This repository contains some Python scripts for numerically solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These scripts were developed during a Numerical Analysis for Partial Differential Equations course attended at TU Delft. A brief explanation of the mathematical problems solved in each script will be added soon.
